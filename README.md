# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains my mini projects related to Machine Learning (ML).

- `main.ipynb` is my learning notebook.
- `catatan.txt` is just a personal note to help me remember what I've learned.
- The `img` folder contains screenshots that support my notes.

I learned all of this from a fantastic mentor. A special thanks to the YouTube channel Codebasics (https://youtu.be/gmvvaobm7eQ?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw) for all the lessons.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. I'm always happy to hear from visitors to this repository!
